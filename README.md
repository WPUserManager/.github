# WP User Manager Default GitHub Files

This repository contains default files used to standardize GitHub issues and pull requests throughout the organization.

## How It Works

The `.github` directory in this project will be used by any repository in `premmerce-wp` that does _not_ have a `.github` directory in its own project root.

For more information, see GitHub documentation for [Creating a repository for default files](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file#creating-a-repository-for-default-files).
